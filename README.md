# Ukrainischer-Chor-Kalyna

### 👉 [Ukrainischer-Chor-Kalyna](https://chor-kalyna.com/)

### ✨ Overview

This is a comprehensive, multi-page, responsive website built for a professional choir. I acted as the sole developer and designer, taking the project from initial concept to a fully optimized production-ready site. Since the project lacked a dedicated designer, I was responsible for the entire visual language and user experience.

### 🎯 Business Goals & Solutions (Product Mindset)

In this project, I bridged the gap between design and engineering to solve specific business needs:
- Brand Identity: Without a pre-existing brand book, I selected a font pairing and color palette that reflects the academic yet creative nature of the ensemble.
- User Journey: I designed the page structure with a focus on conversion, ensuring that CTAs (Call-to-Action) for sponsorships and subscriptions are placed logically within the user flow.
